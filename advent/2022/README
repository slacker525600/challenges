Working through advent of code 2022 challenges in this folder, might rename the repo because of it... 

creating dockerfile just to simplify dependency management locally, and because why not. 
currently just running and putting it into the box on the page, 

docker build . -t aoc2022:latest

docker run aoc2022

may end up making above more involved with day to run ... but fine for now.
